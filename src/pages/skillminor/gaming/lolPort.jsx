                This is more than just a gaming achievement<br></br>
                it has shaped my personal development and essential soft skills<br></br>
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                playing as part of a team strengthened my communication skill<br></br>
                and taught me how to stay composed and effective under pressure.<br></br>
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                Moreover, the experience encouraged me to be proactive<br></br>
                in seeking opportunities and information<br></br>
                <strong>while maintaining diligence and resilience in the face of challenges</strong><br></br>
